With COVID-19 on the rise in the world and especially in Italy, I used live data on the number of positive cases to model 
and predict the growth rate of the virus. I used two growth functions: logistic and exponential. More info can be found in the 
notebook. 
I used a least squares estimate to calculate the error and came to the conclusion that a logistic fit is better than 
an exponential fit.
