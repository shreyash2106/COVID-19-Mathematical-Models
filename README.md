# COVID-19-Models-
A comparison of Logistic and Exponential models applied to COVID-19 infection data in Italy.

With COVID-19 on the rise in the world, I used live data on the number of positive cases in Italy to model 
and predict the growth rate of the virus. I used two growth functions: logistic and exponential. More info can be found in the 
notebook. 
I used a least squares estimate to calculate the error and came to the conclusion that a logistic fit is better than 
an exponential fit.
